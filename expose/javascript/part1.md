3. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why.

Line 9 prints `values added: 20`.

4. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.

The code returns an error when reaching line 13 because the console is trying to access `result`. However, since `result` was defined with `let`, it can only be accessed in the block of code that it was defined. In this case, `result` can only be accessed in the `if` block and not by line 13 which is outside of the scope.

5. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why.

The code returns an error because line 9 is trying to print the `const result` variable and the `const result` variable in the code was written to be changed. Since `const` variables' values cannot be changed, there is an error while running the code and line 9 was not able to execute.

6. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.

The code returns an error because the `result` was declared to be a `const` variable with the value of `0`. However, the following code dictates that we want to change the value of `result`, which is not allowed for `const` variables. Thus, an error was thrown and line 13 was not able to execute.
